title: Colophon

prepitaph is a personal website for a small group of people to exchange (mostly)
technology-related content and to
[record thoughts and experiences](https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/)
for posterity -- primarily our future selves.

Both code and content can be found in the
[public repository](https://github.com/FND/prepitaph).

Thoughts or complaints can be directed at void@prepitaph.org.


Privacy
-------

This website avoids collecting personal data whenever possible. There are no
cookies, third-party trackers or analytics. HTTP server logs only record
requests' date and time as well as protocol, method and URL (e.g.
`GET / HTTP/1.1`) along with the
[referrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) and the corresponding
response's
[status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). IP
addresses or user-agent details are not recorded. Logs are retained for about a
month.

Content is encrypted via [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Network
providers and other intermediaries may still be able to observe connections to
this website, but not what is being transmitted. This also prevents
intermediaries from modifying content.
