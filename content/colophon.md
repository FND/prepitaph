title: Colophon

prepitaph is a personal website for a small group of people to exchange (mostly)
technology-related content and to
[record thoughts and experiences](https://cagrimmett.com/thoughts/2022/04/26/why-blog/)
for posterity -- primarily our future selves.

Both code and content can be found in the
[public repository](https://github.com/FND/prepitaph).

Thoughts or complaints can be directed at info@prepitaph.org.


Privacy
-------

This website avoids collecting personal data whenever possible. There are no
cookies, analytics or third-party trackers. HTTP server logs only record
requests' date and time as well as protocol, method and URL along with
[referrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) and the corresponding
response's status code:

```
[01/Mar/2023:11:27:59 +0000] "GET /colophon/ HTTP/1.1" 200 "https://example.org/"
```

IP addresses or user-agent details are not recorded. Logs are retained for about
a month.

Content is encrypted via [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Network
providers and other intermediaries may still be able to observe connections to
this website, but not what is being transmitted. This also prevents
intermediaries from modifying content.
