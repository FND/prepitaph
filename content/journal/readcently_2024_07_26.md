```intro
Hot on the heels of yesterday's
[inaugural journal](page://journal/readcently-2024-07-25), I've decided to
revisit the handful of bookmarks I currently consider seminal: Pieces I often
refer to in discussions, sometimes with myself.
```

```aside compact
Expect the rate of journal entries to drop considerably after this initial bout
of catch-up activity.

While we're doing meta-commenting: I had to retroactively amend that first
entry, adding another link
[at the very bottom](page://journal/readcently-2024-07-25#the-frontend-treadmill).

[Decision time](https://adactio.com/journal/20564)
--------------------------------------------------

Good design requires thoughtfulness on many dimensions.

> often a decision that delivers short-term gain may well end up delivering
> long-term pain


[Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com)
------------------------------------------------------

Every web practitioner -- whether developer, designer or otherwise -- should
read this concise book explaining the web's fundamental principles, both
philosophically and practically.

```ref core-objectives
The [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0dUvs3jQnw) ( ðŸ“¼ 55 min.) on the
same topic is also worth watching, particularly the process for identifying
[Just what is it that you want to do?](https://adactio.com/journal/7774)
([from 30 min.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0dUvs3jQnw&t=1800s)).
```

It seems obligatory to also point to the
[principle of least power](https://adactio.com/journal/14327) in this context.


[The Market For Lemons](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A thorough analysis of "the front end's lost decade", explaining how a pervasive
lack of engineering discipline made the web worse for both users and
organizations.

There's also an accompanying
[presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnHVNFe_gu0) ( ðŸ“¼ 25 min.).

From
[elsewhere](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/vanilla-javascript-libraries-quest-stateful-dom-rendering/):

> In his seminal piece "The Market For Lemons", renowned web crank Alex Russell
> lays out the myriad failings of our industry, focusing on the disastrous
> consequences for end users. This indignation is entirely appropriate according

> [bylaws of our medium](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies).

I'm afraid we can't mention those bylaws without
[quoting adactio](https://adactio.com/journal/7706) yet again:

> given the choice between making something my problem, and making something
> the user's problem, I'll choose to make it my problem every time


[Design Pressure](https://kellysutton.com/2017/04/18/design-pressure.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Design Pressure is the guidance or "pressure" that test-driven development

> Design Pressure is the little voice in the back of your head made manifest by

This is the reason I almost always end up regretting foregoing TDD, which still
happens occasionally (though [hopefully less so now](page://wip/deno-testing)).

It's closely related to
[deletability](https://kellysutton.com/2017/05/29/deletability.html) in my head:

> To optimize for deletability, we need to make sure we have a clean dependency
> graph. To build a clean dependency graph, we need modular code. Given that
> modular code is seen as a Good Thingâ„¢ in its own right, optimizing for
> deletability is used as a technique to achieve modular and more easily
> understood code.

... which in turn is effectively the same as
[replaceability](page://articles/banishing-npm#ref:replaceability).

```aside compact
You might recognize a theme here. Perhaps a concerning lack of diversity. I'm
conscious of that.
