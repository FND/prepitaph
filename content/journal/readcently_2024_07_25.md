```intro
Loosely inspired by Sara Joy's [Weak Notes](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/notes/), my
breakfast brain decided a facile pun was necessary to finally try something I'd
been considering for a while: Consciously review stuff I've bookmarked,
re-assess with some distance and highlight things that still seem noteworthy.

```aside compact
In a futile attempt to quell my inner completionist, the explicit goal here is
to not be exhaustive; a selective snapshot without any particular criteria,
subject to the whims of the moment.

> Consider interactivity over showing over telling.

In typical adactio style, this reflective piece weaves together a variety of
sources across time, synthesizing didactic advice.

This also led me to watch
[API Design is UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY) ( ðŸ“¼ 25
min.) -- much of which should be self-evident, but clearly isn't; it's always
worth reminding ourselves of
[Just what is it that you want to do?](https://adactio.com/journal/7774).

Prompted by increasing link rot, this essay provides historical and intellectual
context for the web's significance as a cultural medium.

Unfortunately, I'm now tempted to add a "related posts" section beneath articles
on this here website. Given those inner voices, that might turn into a dangerous
forever commitment to cross-reference all content in perpetuity.

[The Case For Design Engineers](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-case-for-design-engineers-pt-ii/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since first reading this, I've repeatedly referred to the example within; it's
great for explaining why
[material](https://alistapart.com/article/material-honesty-on-the-web/)
[honesty](https://resilientwebdesign.com/chapter2/#material%20honesty) matters.

Relatedly, [Web Design Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su6WA0kUUJE)
( ðŸ“¼ 50 min.) left a lasting impression -- even though, or perhaps precisely
because, I myself was already a convert: It took some time for the wider
implications to sink in and I continue pondering how we as developers might
support other constituencies.

Despite disagreeing with some of the decisions (see discussion in the thread
above), I really liked the nuanced, self-critical examination of this case
study. That's exactly the kind of treatment this industry needs more of.


[The Frontend Treadmill](https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/)

Directly related to the case study above:

> Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming

In the same vein, there's an interesting
[exchange](https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/112761578592242458) on robust
front-end architectures, with real-world anecdotes of reputable organizations
being bogged down by accidental complexity.
