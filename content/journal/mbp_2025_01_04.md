```intro
I'm in the process of setting up a new-ish MacBook. Unusually, this isn't
currently my primary machine, which gives me some leeway to really start from
scratch instead of just transferring all the cruft accumulated over the years.
```

```aside
After having been a full-time Ubuntu and Arch Linux user since at least 2008, in
late 2013 I relented and got a MacBook Pro due to then-unrivaled hardware
(notably retina displays, but also microphone quality and silent cooling fans).
I did so very much reluctantly and merely out of desperation, as Apple's pricing
and walled-garden policies always seemed appalling.

Switching to OS X (now macOS) in the process was a conscious decision, mostly to
skip the never-ending hassle of figuring out Linux compatibility. But at least
it's a Unix system: I made sure to avoid vendor lock-in by shunning OS-specific
monocultures. That meant relying on portable (i.e. terminal- and web-based)
applications for almost everything -- though that was pretty much the case
already anyway. I remain convinced that was and is the right approach.

Nevertheless, a few years ago one indispensable macOS-only application forced
its way through my defenses, so that's something to contend with once
enshittification inevitably makes me switch back.
```

Stepping through macOS's Setup Assistant was enraging in various ways, in no
small part because dodging **privacy** invasions and similar nuisances is
getting increasingly tricky[privacy](footnote://): Suppressing Siri, Apple
Intelligence, location services and telemetry wasn't always straightforward,
especially because some of those features require additional tweaks in System
Settings later on (e.g. imposing various Spotlight constraints and disabling
Apple Intelligence Report via Privacy & Security).[whacamole](footnote://)

```footnote privacy
Of course privacy violations are common in almost all contemporary systems.
Propaganda notwithstanding, Apple is an exemption only in the sense that it
makes you pay exorbitant sums for the privilege.
```

```footnote whacamole
I'm very much uncertain whether there's anything I've missed -- not to mention
that it's a game of Whac-A-Mole, with new violations being added over time
(typically unannounced).

macOS appears to auto-generate the machine's **identifiers**; we might want to
double-check and perhaps correct those early on <small>(System Settings →
General → name and … → Sharing → hostname)</small>:
```

```shell
$ hostname
$ scutil --get HostName
$ scutil --get LocalHostName
$ scutil --get ComputerName
```

An important detail for me to remember here is the **keyboard** layout: Avoiding
[dead keys](https://kbdlayout.info/features/deadkeys) means choosing _US_ rather
than _US International_. While we're there, we might as well activate
[Keyboard Navigation](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/)
<small>(System Settings → Keyboard)</small>, remap Caps Lock to Escape <small>(…
→ Keyboard Shortcuts → Modifier Keys)</small> and disable all autocorrections
<small>(… → Input Sources)</small>.

Speaking of accessibility, a while ago I resorted to increasing the default
**font size** <small>(System Settings → Displays → reduce resolution)</small>.
In order to avoid the **menu bar** being influenced by the wallpaper, I opt for
reduced transparency <small>(System Settings → Accessibility → Display)</small>.
I also prefer to hide the **Dock** by default for more screen estate
<small>(System Settings → Desktop & Dock)</small>, given that I typically launch
applications via Spotlight or the command line[console](footnote://) anyway.
```

```footnote console
I basically live in iTerm2's hotkey window, configured as Quake-style drop-down
console.
```

Another detail I can never remember is to
[make **screenshots** open in Preview](https://www.howtogeek.com/403519/how-to-change-macos-mojaves-default-screenshot-location/)
instead of immediately saving to file: ⌘⇧5 pops up the toolbar where we can
edit options.

After completing those basics, we can move on to install
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as **package manager** and perhaps
[disable analytics](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics) there. We should not ignore
Homebrew's post-install instructions for extending our shell profile (i.e.
`~/.profile`).

Next we revert to Bash as our **default shell** (`chsh -s /bin/bash`) as that
ensures we don't rely on non-standard shell features. However, it might be a
good idea to install the latest version of Bash via Homebrew[bash](footnote://) --
otherwise adding `export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1` to our shell
profile suppresses constant macOS nagging.

```footnote bash
This requires first extending `/etc/shells` and then invoking `chsh` again with
the respective path:

'''shell
$ echo $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
$ chsh -s $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
'''

All because Apple fears GPLv3...
```

Now might be a good time to install essential applications like iTerm2 and
Firefox. (Not sure I wanna share my full
[Brewfile](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f)
here, though it's fairly slim.)

At this point, I'm typically ready to transfer my dotfiles -- except I started
from scratch, or at least reviewed every single line, this time around. That's a
post for another day.
