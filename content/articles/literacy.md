> I got my first full time remote job in 2004. I've been remote ever since. I've
> read or heard so many different techniques for making remote successful,
> whatever the composition of the team. But there's no magic to it.

> The technique that matters is simple to understand and hard to implement:
> Everyone on the team must read. Everyone on the team must write.

> If you have collaborative tools that are supposed to help, the help that
> matters is helping you read and helping you write.

> The type of writing that matters is not little blurbs like this tweet, short
> slack messages, or emoji acks like 👍. It's narrative. Interpretation and
> summation of what's happened, happening, going to happen.

> If you want to be remote, learn to be literate. If you want your team to
> support remote workers, make time for literature.

FND's collection reveals similar sentiments from others and provides further
evidence on why literacy is important in general:

* [Why Write?](https://fs.blog/why-write/)

    > Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand
    > what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by
    > which you figure it out.

* [Why Blog?](https://cagrimmett.com/2022/04/26/why-blog/)

    > Writing and publishing forces you to solidify and clarify your thoughts.

* [Good and useful writing](https://robinrendle.com/notes/good-and-useful-writing-/)

    > writing is for thinking first, communication last

* [Creativity is the byproduct of work ](https://robinrendle.com/notes/creativity-is-the-byproduct-of-work/)

    > You are not creative and then create something, you become creative by
    > working on something, creativity is a byproduct of work.

* [Amazon Staff Meetings: "No Powerpoint"](https://conorneill.com/2012/11/30/amazon-staff-meetings-no-powerpoint/)

    > When you have to write your ideas out in complete sentences, complete
    > paragraphs it forces a deeper clarity.
    >
    > […]
    >
    > "think complex, speak simple". It is hard work to prepare well enough to
    > be able to speak simple. Most presenters are figuring out what they really
    > want to say as they are presenting. This is a terrible waste of an
    > audience.

* [I hate the Gemini "Dear Sydney" ad more every passing moment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/google-gemini-ai-dear-sydney-ad-olympics-satire/)

    > All of the buffoons excited by the prospect of AI taking over all our
    > writing […] are missing the point in a spectacular manner. Do you know
    > what writing is?
    >
    > It is thinking in a form that you can share with other people. It is a
    > method for taking thoughts and images and stories out of your brain and
    > putting them into someone else's brain. E.M. Forster quotes a woman
    > saying, "How can I tell what I think until I see what I say?" To take away
    > the ability to write for yourself is to take away the ability to think for
    > yourself.
