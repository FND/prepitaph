Recently a soon-to-be-ex colleague unexpectedly stated:

That is pretty much the nicest compliment imaginable. It also nicely summarizes
my philosophy. There are certainly worse legacies one could claim.

I'm genuinely surprised that my inane utterances over the years were impactful
enough to solicit this response. I don't recall what exactly I might have said
that stuck, but I'm guessing it's stuff like repeatedly emphasizing that I have
a limited cognitive buffer -- which, in addition to being highly annoying, can
be a major asset as it forces both me and others to reduce
[unnecessary complexity](page://articles/attractive-nuisance).

```aside compact
Being vocal about such limitations is a conscious strategy, partly to signal
humane expectations while also serving as preemptive defense mechanism.
```

This admission thus procures some leeway to question prima-facie acceptance of
IDEs, type systems, obscurant tooling and whatever else undermines plain-text
computing. More generally, and perhaps more constructively, it's a lever to
prompt discussions about
[what we're actually trying to achieve](page://journal/readcently-2024-07-26#ref:core-objectives).

The title of this post is another one of those lessons I had drilled into me by
cdent: Acknowledging constraints isn't just useful to account for human factors,
it also provides effective boundaries in navigating solution space when
designing systems and interactions. (Back then, this mostly came up in the
context of HTTP APIs.) You might even argue that
[constraints are a prerequisite for creativity](https://robinrendle.com/notes/creativity-is-the-byproduct-of-work/).
