```intro
Purveyors of software must exercise reasonable care to guard against
decontextualization of architectural choices.

It occurred to me that this analogy applies to many technology choices these
days; my immediate reaction was "That's exactly what
React/Kubernetes/microservices/… are!". Such complex tools might be valuable
within the context they were created for, but are all too easily adopted
elsewhere without considering constraints and
[support](https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/109389047292856699)
[structures](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/#fn-everything-in-moderation-2).
This kind of willful context blindness has become an issue not just on the
[supply side](https://web.archive.org/web/20230517114359/https://scribe.rip/the-industrial-hammer-complex-d9785886ee59),
but is perhaps even more pronounced on the
[consuming end](https://adactio.com/links/20269).

It's like purchasing an aircraft carrier for your inflatable pool, without crew
or [escort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_battle_group). Not only is it
a huge
[waste of resources](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/25/is-software-getting-worse/),
it also renders the pool
[unusable](https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/) to those who
might rely on it.
