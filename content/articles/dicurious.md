> being sent to the dictionary is a **gift**
```

As someone with a reputation for excessive use of abbreviations, I am
occasionally asked to compose a list of common acronyms and such, making them
easier for people to decode. My perennial response is to refuse, pointing out
that I'd hate to deprive my correspondent of the opportunity to discover unknown
treasures while searching the web.

Similarly, I'm often stumped when being chastised for using (supposedly) big
words -- which is how cdent came to exclaim the above: Words have meaning and
communication is important. Being capable of expressing yourself concisely and
understanding subtleties is often crucial; a nuanced vocabulary with a grasp of
connotations can be immensely helpful. The most effective way to learn that is
through exposure, in which case looking things up is what readers are supposed
to do! So pick up that dictionary; be dicurious!
