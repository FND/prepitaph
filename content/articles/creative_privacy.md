```intro
Allowing users to tinker in private is essential to enabling creativity.
```

This is one of the many lessons from my [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com)
days: Sprung from the mind of
[Jeremy Ruston](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/JeremyRuston.html), TiddlyWiki is
a marvelously anomalous creature on the web in that, at its core, it's just a
local HTML file which can save itself. That's useful in many ways, but perhaps
most importantly, it affords users a sense of
[psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety):

Without being connected to a server, the latent (not necessarily conscious)
feeling of potentially being observed vanishes as data never leaves the user's
machine. This has [proven to be effective](https://youtu.be/OFstPn355xQ?t=2400)
in encouraging experimentation without being afraid to make mistakes -- also
because recovering is as simple as restoring a previous file. (It's really worth
listening to Jeremy's explanation there for a minute or two.)

I was recently reminded of this upon encountering a discussion on collaboration
tools (via [Blaine](https://twitter.com/blaine), who also happens to be an
[Osmonaut](http://web.archive.org/web/20110202100921/http://osmosoft.com/)),
where Geoffrey Litt
[used](https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1633954417522413568) the term
"creative privacy" -- I hadn't encountered that before.

Unfortunately, modern digital tools often disregard this aspect.
