This was my response when, back in 2009, someone on IRC thanked me for spending
time to help them with their website. It has since become shorthand for making
others' life easier because we can, helping me frame the concept of volunteering
assistance -- for both myself and others.

Philosophers and economists probably have more erudite terms for the same idea.
