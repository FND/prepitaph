```intro
Bugs are an opportunity for the community to reveal itself.

Back in the TiddlyWiki days, cdent pointed out:

> its destiny.

You might argue that's just restating
[Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law). However, the school
of cdent goes one step further: Bugs are good for a healthy community. That is,
perfectionism in (open-source) software might not be desirable because flaws
present an opportunity for dialog. Depending on the circumstances, conversations
of this kind might even be worth sacrificing backwards compatibility.
