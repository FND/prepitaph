[TIL](https://moderncss.dev/12-modern-css-one-line-upgrades/)
`color-scheme: dark` automatically changes form fields' appearance. This
greatly simplifies theming because it saves us arduous attempts to style native
controls, let alone
[replaced elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element),
which usually ends badly.

```embed uri=./demo.html resize=demo
