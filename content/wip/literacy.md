> I got my first full time remote job in 2004. I've been remote ever since. I've
> read or heard so many different techniques for making remote successful,
> whatever the composition of the team. But there's no magic to it.

> The technique that matters is simple to understand and hard to implement:
> Everyone on the team must read. Everyone on the team must write.

> If you have collaborative tools that are supposed to help, the help that
> matters is helping you read and helping you write.

> The type of writing that matters is not little blurbs like this tweet, short
> slack messages, or emoji acks like 👍. It's narrative. Interpretation and
> summation of what's happened, happening, going to happen.

> **If you want to be remote, learn to be literate. If you want your team to
> support remote workers, make time for literature.**

> Stories help to create and verify the shared language and understanding that
> are the prerequisites for shared goals and shared actions.
