```intro
Overcommunicate while being mindful of the work you leave for others.
```

I routinely find myself thrown into new collaboration environments, where I
frequently end up explaining what I've learned about making distributed
collaboration more effective and pleasant. This is an attempt to capture _some_
of that received wisdom.

```aside
As a social process, communication is inherently contextual and subject to
interpretation. Thus this piece is inevitably incomplete, somewhat contradictory
and merely intended to spark conversation and debate.

*   [read and write](page://articles/literacy)

    Text communication remains our most fundamental, effective and sustainable
    tool -- regardless of medium.

*   overcommunicate, even if it's awkward

    This might mean being proactive in sharing what you're doing and why, but it
    could also mean responding to others' messages: Receiving nothing but
    crickets and tumbleweed can feel particularly alienating to authors in a
    digital setting.

*   humor spawns community, community begets trust, trust is the foundation for
    progress and civilization

    Banter is essential for group cohesion: Not everything needs to be
    goal-oriented, scheduled or otherwise highly disciplined.

*   async by default

    Unless you're in an active exchange, it's usually okay for responses to take
    a little while.

    [Resist the temptation to go synchronous](https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/):
    It might feel simpler and easier, but that's often an
    [illusion](page://articles/constraints) -- in part because it means anyone
    not present is excluded (which might even be your future self). It helps to
    assume that at least one member of the team is deaf; that automatically
    guides you towards patterns where important stuff is accessible and
    retrievable in textual form.

*   be wary of persistent history

    Written communication tends to stick around forever. That might not be what
    you want for every message, so be conscious of that.

    Relatedly: Chat should not turn into an ad-hoc knowledge base.


Be Mindful of the Work You Leave for Others
-------------------------------------------

While overcommunication is essential, it's worth being cognizant of the burden
communication might impose on others.

*   distinguish important ðŸ”• from urgent ðŸ””

    In practical terms, this mostly means consciously avoiding immediate
    notifications unless absolutely necessary: You don't want to force folks
    into a context switch.

    Unfortunate defaults in enterprise chat applications mean that it's often
    better to avoid direct messages, e.g. in favor of dedicated (perhaps
    transient) channels -- which come with the added benefit of topical
    distinction. Similarly, direct mentions (typically "@â€¦") might not be
    warranted.

*   optimize for recipients

    Messages are usually read more often than they are written. Any shortcuts
    you take as an author (e.g. stream-of-consciousness narration or
    disregarding spelling) might increase the effort it takes readers to
    interpret your message.

    [Bottom Line Up Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_%28communication%29)
    is an important principle: You generally want to lead with key information
    (conclusions, expected actions, uncertainties etc.), which includes being
    explicit (e.g. about requests, expectations or task assignments) -- more
    detailed explanations and background information is typically still
    necessary, but should be distinct.

*   channel discipline

    Most environments provide mechanisms for distinguishing topical discussions,
    e.g. via channels or rooms. Try to put messages where they're most
    appropriate, taking into account the respective audience.

    However, excessively strict categorization is unhelpful; consider following
    [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle).
